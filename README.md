# AB InBev Internal Environment Analysis

## Executive Summary
This project analyzes AB InBev’s internal environment, focusing on HRM, diversity management, financial and non-financial performance, and overall strategic readiness. Using interviews, financial ratio analysis, and a full internal report, the project evaluates how AB InBev’s strengths and weaknesses enable it to respond to external opportunities and threats, supported by a structured SWOT and confrontation matrix.

## Business Problems
AB InBev faces high debt levels, potential HRM pressures, and diversity limitations, all of which affect financial flexibility, employee management, investment decisions, and long-term competitiveness in the global beverage market.

## Key Questions
- How does AB InBev’s debt affect liquidity, leverage, and competitiveness?  
- How do financial constraints impact workforce policies and HR practices?  
- What strategies can strengthen financial flexibility and HR effectiveness?  
- How do internal strengths and weaknesses influence AB InBev’s ability to respond to external market pressures?

## Methodology
- **Qualitative research:** 5 semi-structured interviews (Appendix 3).

- **SWOT & confrontation matrix:** Integrating all HR, financial, and environmental findings.
